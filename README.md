# Coding-Quiz
This website is a quiz on the topic of coding.

You are taken to a page where you can push a button. This starts a series of questions. These questions are timed. If you choose a wrong answer you lose ten seconds. At the end, the number of correct answers is multiplied by your remaining time to calculate your score.  

# Challenges

This was a very challenging project. There were so many new concepts and moving parts. Each time I finished one thing, It seemed like five more tasks appeared. Recording and checking the correct answers was very challenging.  I had a difficult time getting buttons contaning the answers to generate on the page at first. My main difficulty was trying to get the high scores to appear on the high scores page. I succeeded in this and now the scores display with the highest at the top of the table.

# What I learned

I learned a lot about the DOM and using Javascript to interact with the webpage. I learned about local storage and how to save to it.  I learned about recording inputs from buttons and using this informatio.
